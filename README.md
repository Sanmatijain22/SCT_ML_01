# SCT_ML_01
A linear regression project to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. Built using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and visualized with Matplotlib/Seaborn. Completed as part of SkillCraft Technology Task 01.
🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This repository contains Task 01 for the SkillCraft Technology Internship Program, where the goal is to implement a Linear Regression model to predict the prices of houses based on:

🏠 Square footage

🛏️ Number of bedrooms

🛁 Number of bathrooms

📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to use supervised machine learning (linear regression) to develop a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on key numerical features.

📊 Dataset
The dataset includes multiple housing records with attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the corresponding house prices.

🔗 Note: The dataset used for this project can be uploaded manually in Google Colab (e.g., house_data.csv).

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas for data manipulation

NumPy for numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the regression model

Google Colab for cloud-based execution

⚙️ Steps Involved
Data Loading and Cleaning

Handling missing values

Selecting relevant features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing the relationships between features and price

Model Training

Splitting the data into training and testing sets

Fitting a Linear Regression model

Model Evaluation

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

Visualization

Actual vs Predicted price plot

📈 Results
The final model demonstrates the ability to predict house prices with reasonable accuracy and offers a baseline for further model improvements or feature engineering.

🚀 How to Run
Open the Colab notebook.

Upload the house_data.csv file when prompted.
